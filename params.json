And rightly so, it was a significant change in the appearance of the WP Admin area, and if not disabled in your User Profile, the front-end of your site as well. Many tips, tricks and plugins for customizing the Admin Bar began appearing around the Web. And then just as the dust began to settle, BAM - the \"Admin Bar\" transforms into the \"Toolbar\" with the WordPress 3.3 update.\r\n\r\nThe WordPress 3.3 update focused heavily on streamlining and optimizing the Admin experience. The Admin Bar of WP 3.1 was intended as the \"first step toward a front-end editor\". The original Admin Bar was debated for several good reasons:\r\n\r\n* Enabled on the front-end by default\r\n* Gobbles up too much vertical screen space\r\n* Redundant, all links available elsewhere\r\n* Not visually appealing in general\r\n\r\n[Ipstenu wrote it](//wordpress.org/support/topic/hiding-admin-bar-in-wordpress-33#post-2495448)\r\n\r\n`\r\n\"You don't have to like it, but it's here to stay.\"\r\nSo it's time to look at things practically and get on with it.\r\nFirst of all, if you have a plugin or functions script that hides,\r\nremoves, or customizes the Admin Bar, definitely investigate to see\r\nif everything is still working according to plan.\r\n\r\nAfter years of testing, since release of WordPress 3.1+, after others\r\nreleases of WordPress, at today, all work fine without any trouble.\r\n`\r\n\r\nUsing the many Admin Bar tricks that became available around the Web, WordPress users dealt with the thing in their own way and moved on with their lives. Some use plugins, some custom snippets and scripts, some just love it as-is.\r\n\r\n... to be continued?\r\n\r\n= Admin Bar is dead long live the Toolbar =\r\n\r\nIf you've updated to WP 3.3, you've seen the smaller \"Toolbar\" tucked neat above the Admin area. The new Admin Bar Toolbar seems to address some of the main concerns about the old Admin Bar:\r\n\r\n* No longer enabled on front-end by default\r\n* Uses less vertical screen space\r\n* Integrates the Admin header area, so no longer redundant\r\n* It looks a little better (in my opinion)\r\n\r\nFor those who have not yet updated or have no idea what's going on, here is a visual comparison of the old \"Admin Bar\" and the new \"Toolbar\":\r\n\r\nThe new Toolbar certainly looks better, but concerns remain. From what i've gathered, the main gripe is that the Toolbar is mandatory, and possibly still redundant, depending on site setup and configuration (plugins, networks, etc.).\r\n\r\n... is it really mandatory?\r\n\r\n== Screenshots ==\r\n\r\n1. \"Old\" Admin Bar: bigger, clunkier, and redundant ...\r\n2. \"New\" Toolbar: smaller, simpler, but redundant ...\r\n3. \"Old\" Admin Bar Personal Options: full control ...\r\n4. \"New\" Toolbar Personal Options: bamboozled! Not disabled for backend!\r\n5. Admin Bar and Toolbar with \"One Click Logout Barless\" add-on Plugin ...\r\n6. Dashboard with \"WP Toolbar Removal\": faster and user friendly ...\r\n7. Personal Options: not needed if Admin Bar or Toolbar is disadled and removed!\r\n\r\n== Disclaimer ==\r\n\r\n[sLaNGjIs team do not providing support on wordpress.org forum](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-bar-removal/other_notes/) because we are not interested in reviews o stars on our plugins!\r\n\r\nDear user of plugins or themes:\r\n\r\n`\r\nsLaNGjIs Team has started your adventure on\r\nWordPress.org forum 8 years ago since 2007!\r\n`\r\n\r\nEverything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.\r\n\r\nThe traffic generated by users of the WordPress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.\r\n\r\nIn the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, both the posts and threads definable \"requests\" and those definable \"trash\" are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, the problems of this type of assistance have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered insufficient or inadequate to many of them.\r\n\r\nMany of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of customer care.\r\n\r\nOur team has tried to respond to all for more long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean, neat, and clear.\r\n\r\nFailing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, through the instruments of WordPress.org forum, as of today August 15, 2014 we abandon the active support with this type of structure, started since July 7, 2007 to try to give one type of service more personalized, and targeted, to requests of users.\r\n\r\n1.
